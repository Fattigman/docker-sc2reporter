## Getting Started

To launch the application using mock data, ensure you have Docker Compose installed on your system. Follow these steps for a more advanced setup:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

```

git clone https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/docker-sc2reporter

```

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**

Move into the cloned repository's directory:

```

cd docker-sc2reporter

```

3.  **Start Application:**
