# Prefix URL Configuration
The prefix URL in this project is controlled by the environment variable \`REACT_APP_PREFIX_URL\`. By default, it is set to \`/\` to prevent any potential interference with Firebase hosting actions. When the project is run in production, the \`REACT_APP_PREFIX_URL\` variable can be configured with a different value as needed.
