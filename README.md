# docker-sc2reporter
Dockerized version of the sc2reporter program. Originally written by Björn Hallström, but through a long line of coders (2) it has ended up in my hands.

# Note!
This pipeline is as of now not ready to be deployed. It is currently in development. Without further adooooo.


# Usage

Follow the two options described here:
  * [Development](https://github.com/Fattigman/docker-sc2reporter/blob/main/docs/DEV_ENV.md)
  * [Production](https://github.com/Fattigman/docker-sc2reporter/blob/main/docs/PROD_ENV.md)


# Future development
Work in progress from highest to lowest priority:
  * Visualisation of phylogenetic trees.
  * Generalized environment variables for easier deployment on different systems.
  * Better documentation. When the project gets closer to production, the priority of the documentation will increase.
  * Some packages may not be listed as of now, and all packages versions need to specified.
